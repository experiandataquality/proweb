				</td>
				<td>
					<p><strong>Typical use</strong>: Capturing a customer's address on a website using optimal entry of information.</p>
					<p class="light"><strong>Description</strong>: This type of address entry takes the form of a wizard.
						The customer selects the country first and is then prompted to enter key elements of their address.
						When this results in multiple matches, the customer is prompted to pick from a list of addresses.</p>
					<br />

				<td class="product">
					<p><a href="VerifyInput.aspx">Address Verification</a></p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p><strong>Typical use</strong>: Verifying a customer's address as entered in full on an existing website form.</p>
					<p class="light"><strong>Description</strong>: This type of address entry is designed to be unobtrusive and to work
						with forms where the customer types in their whole address.
						Good matches are cleaned and formatted, otherwise the customer is prompted to correct the address,
						to accept it as is, or to pick from a list of possible matches.</p>

				<td class="product">
					<p><a href="KeyCountry.aspx">Key Search</a></p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p><strong>Typical use</strong>: As part of Intranet or Commercial Website as a separate search option to reverse search an address based on a Key value.</p> 
					<p class="light"><strong>Description</strong>: This returns an address based on a Key value taken as input. It is possible that the 
						Key matches more than one address in which case a list will be displayed. This is only available with certain datasets that contain a logical reverse search Key (Ex: United Kingdom with Gas data contains a Meter Number (MPRN) that can be searched on).</p>

				<td class="product">
					<p><a href="Intuitive.aspx">Intuitive Search</a></p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p><strong>Typical use</strong>: Completely untrained customers capturing their own address in a Web or Intranet environment.</p> 
					<p class="light"><strong>Description</strong>: Using a single entry field, a customer enters their address as they would know it from traditional posting formats. Commas are handled if entered but are not required. From a drop-down box, suggestions for possible addresses are suggested until enough information has been added to accurately ascertain the address. This can then be chosen with the arrow keys or the mouse.</p>

					<p>&#8211; <a href="RapidIndex.htm">Standard</a></p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p><strong>Typical use</strong>: Rapid entry of a customer's address either over the phone or from a coupon.</p>
					<p class="light"><strong>Description</strong>: This is the fastest and most flexible type of address entry,
						designed for trained operators who need to capture a customer's address quickly.
						The operator enters a minimal amount of address information and then drills
						down through a series of lists to home-in on the required address.</p>

					<p>&#8211; <a href="HierInput.aspx">Single Line</a></p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p><strong>Typical use</strong>: As for the Standard scenario but compatible with a wider range of browsers and environments.</p>
					<p class="light"><strong>Description</strong>: This follows the same principles as the Standard Rapid Addressing scenario but
						does not update the resulting list after every keystroke.
						The operator enters one or more address elements and then presses the Enter key to view the list of possible matches.</p>
					<br />
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="product">
					<p>&#8211; <a href="BulkVerifyInput.aspx">Bulk Processing</a></p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p><strong>Typical use</strong>: to allow multiple verifications to be processed in a single SOAP request.</p>
					<p class="light"><strong>Description</strong>: For each input address the server will return the verification level,
					the input address, and in cases where the address is verified the formatted address.</p>

					<p><strong>Typical use</strong>: Monitoring the state of the QAS server.</p>
					<p class="light"><strong>Description</strong>: This provides diagnostic information on the installed datasets and the state
						of the server, so the administrator can determine if it is operating correctly.
						It is recommended that this page is checked when the product is installed and after configuration
						changes have been made.</p>
